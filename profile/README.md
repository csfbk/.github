# Center for Cybersecurity

The benefits of digital innovation are not without risks such as the loss of control over citizensâ€™ personal data, distortions of the democratic life of nations due to fake news and cyberattacks that threaten critical infrastructures. The pandemic has rapidly pushed a pre-existing digital transformation process with large-scale experiments in remote work and education, while amplifying cyber risks. The Center for Cybersecurity aims to constantly improve cyber risk management by focusing on two main research lines: digital identity and virtual services quality.
